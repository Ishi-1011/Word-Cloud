Happy reading!
Business analytics refers to the use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, and predictive modeling to help organizations make informed decisions and improve their operations. In the context of business consulting engagements, business analytics plays a critical role in helping consultants provide effective guidance and recommendations to their clients. Here are some key ways in which business analytics can be important in consulting engagements:

Data-driven decision-making: Business analytics allows consultants to analyze and interpret data from a variety of sources, including financial data, customer data, and operational data. This data can be used to inform decision-making, identify areas for improvement, and develop strategies for growth. 
For example, a consultant working with a retail client may use sales data to identify the most profitable product categories and determine which products should be promoted or discounted. The consultant can also use customer data to identify patterns in customer behavior and preferences, which can inform marketing and product development strategies.

Performance tracking: Business analytics can help consultants track the performance of their clients' operations, including revenue, profitability, efficiency, and productivity. By monitoring these key metrics, consultants can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to optimize performance. 
For example, a consultant working with a manufacturing client may use production data to identify bottlenecks in the production process and develop strategies to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

Predictive modeling: Business analytics allows consultants to use data to develop predictive models that can help clients anticipate and prepare for future trends and challenges. This can help clients make proactive decisions and stay ahead of the competition. 
For example, a consultant working with a financial services client may use market data and economic indicators to develop a model for predicting changes in interest rates or stock prices, which can inform investment strategies.

Benchmarking: Business analytics can help consultants benchmark their clients' performance against industry standards and best practices. This can help clients identify areas where they are lagging behind their competitors and develop strategies for improvement.
For example, a consultant working with a healthcare client may use data on patient outcomes and treatment costs to benchmark the client's performance against other healthcare providers and identify areas for improvement.
In conclusion, I would say that Business Analytics are a guide, catalyst, coach and a rectifier for any consulting job. If we consider Consulting as a vehicle, taking an organization from point A to point B, we can say Analytics are the Dashboard of that vehicle. It shows us where we are, it enables us to make correct decisions regarding speed, direction etc. and also measure the performance of our travel (read Organizational travel).
